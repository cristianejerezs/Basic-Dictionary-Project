# Basic-Dictionary-Project
First GitHub repository, based on the dictionary project provided by Ardit Sulce in his udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

Striving to improve overall skills with git, github and programming at the same time. 

The dictionary perse is supposed to find the input word's meaning in the dictionary data provided in the DicData.json, aditionally correct the spelling mistakes and returning a 
suggested aproximate word and it's meaning if it can't find the original input word. 

Note: I feel a little bit cheating the program by using the autocorrect library so probably i will do several branches.
